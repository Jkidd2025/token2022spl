# Admin Account Management Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the administration account structure, security measures, and best practices for managing administrative access in the token system. It provides comprehensive guidelines for secure account management and operation.

## Account Structure

### 1. Main Admin Wallet

**Purpose:**

- Initial token creation and setup
- Temporary control of mint and freeze authorities
- Configuration of permanent delegate authority
- Management of fee collector setup

**Security Requirements:**

- Hardware wallet storage
- Regular key rotation
- Access logging

### 2. Fee Collector Account

**Purpose:**

- Receiving transfer fees
- Managing fee distribution
- Maintaining operational balance

**Configuration:**

```typescript
interface FeeCollectorConfig {
  address: PublicKey;
  minSolBalance: number; // 0.1 SOL
  targetSolBalance: number; // 0.5 SOL
  associatedTokenAccount: PublicKey;
  withdrawalThreshold: bigint;
}
```

### 3. Permanent Delegate Account

**Purpose:**

- Control of burn operations
- Management of token destruction
- Authority over critical operations

**Security Considerations:**

- Non-revocable nature
- Operation limits
- Monitoring requirements

## Security Implementation

### 1. Authority Management

```typescript
interface AuthorityConfig {
  // Operation limits
  limits: {
    maxAmount: bigint;
    maxOperationsPerDay: number;
    cooldownPeriod: number;
  };

  // Emergency controls
  emergencyController: PublicKey;
}
```

### 2. Access Control

- Role-based access control
- Operation limits
- Rate limiting
- Emergency procedures

### 3. Monitoring and Logging

- Transaction monitoring
- Access logging
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics

### 4. Backup Procedures

- Regular wallet backups
- Key rotation schedule
- Recovery procedures
- Emergency access protocols

## Best Practices

1. **Key Management**

   - Use hardware wallets
   - Regular key rotation
   - Secure key storage
   - Access logging

2. **Operation Limits**

   - Daily operation limits
   - Transaction size limits
   - Rate limiting
   - Cooldown periods

3. **Emergency Procedures**

   - Emergency pause
   - Recovery protocols
   - Backup access
   - Incident response

4. **Monitoring**

   - Transaction monitoring
   - Balance tracking
   - Error alerts
   - Performance metrics

5. **Documentation**
   - Operation logs
   - Access records
   - Incident reports
   - Recovery procedures

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk                | Impact | Mitigation                             |
| ------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Account Compromise  | High   | Multi-sig, hardware wallet, monitoring |
| Unauthorized Access | High   | Access control, logging, alerts        |
| System Failure      | Medium | Backup procedures, recovery testing    |
| Human Error         | Medium | Training, validation checks            |
