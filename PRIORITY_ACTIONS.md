# Priority Actions for Mainnet Deployment

## Immediate Actions (Week 1)

### Critical Security

1. Implement transaction simulation before execution
2. Add comprehensive input validation
3. Review and secure all private key handling
4. Audit fee collector and burn account permissions
5. Verify all transaction signing processes

### Essential Testing

1. Create basic test suite for core functions:
   - Token swaps
   - Fee collection
   - Distribution logic
   - Balance management
2. Test all error handling paths
3. Verify recovery mechanisms

### Configuration Security

1. Move all hardcoded values to environment variables
2. Create secure key management process
3. Set up mainnet RPC endpoints with fallbacks
4. Configure proper transaction confirmation levels

## Week 2 Priority

### Monitoring Setup

1. Implement basic monitoring for:
   - Fee collector balance
   - Failed transactions
   - Distribution status
2. Set up critical alerts for:
   - Low balances
   - Failed distributions
   - Security events

### Error Handling

1. Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
2. Add circuit breakers for:
   - Maximum transaction attempts
   - Price impact limits
   - Balance changes

### Performance

1. Optimize batch processing
2. Configure proper RPC connection handling
3. Implement transaction priority fees

## Week 3 Priority

### Documentation

1. Create deployment documentation
2. Document configuration requirements
3. Create emergency procedures
4. Document monitoring setup

### Final Testing

1. Complete end-to-end testing
2. Test monitoring and alerts
3. Verify all recovery procedures
4. Test deployment process
